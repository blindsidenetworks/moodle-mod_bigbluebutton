BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system that enables universities and colleges to deliver a high-quality learning experience to remote students.  

These instructions describe how to install the RecordingsBN Activity Module for Moodle 2.0/2.1.  This module is developed and supported by Blindside Networks, the company that started the BigBlueButton project in 2007.

With this plugin you can
	- Create resource links to recordings made with BigBlueButton (requires bigbluebuttonbn plugin to be installed)
	- Publish/unpublish and delete recordings

Prerequisites:

You need a:

	1.  A server running Moodle 2.0+

        ./bigbluebuttonbn
        
3.  Login to your moodle site as administrator

4.  Click the 'Upgrade' button.  

	The activity module will install mod_bigbluebuttonbn.
