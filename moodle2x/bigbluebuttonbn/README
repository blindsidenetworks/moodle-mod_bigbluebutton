BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system that enables universities and colleges to deliver a high-quality learning experience to remote students.  

These instructions describe how to install the BigBlueButtonBN Activity Module for Moodle 2.0/2.1.  This module is developed and supported by Blindside Networks, the company that started the BigBlueButton project in 2007.

With this plugin you can
	- Create links in any class to a BigBlueButton session 
	- Specify join open/close dates that will appear in the Moodle calendar
	- Create a custom welcome messages that appears in the chat window when users join the session
	- Launch BigBlueButton in its own window
	- Restrict students from entering the session until a teacher joins
	- Monitor the active sessions for the course and end any session (eject all users)
	- Record and playback your lectures (requires BigBlueButton 0.8-beta)
	- Access and manage recorded lectures (requires recordingsbn plugin to be installed)

Prerequisites:
============
You need a:

	1.  A server running Moodle 2.0+
	2.  A BigBlueButton server (running on a separate, dedicated server)
	
Blindside Networks provides you a test BigBlueButton server for testing this plugin.  To use this test server, just accept the default settings when configuring the activity module.
